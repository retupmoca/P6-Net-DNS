Net::DNS
========

A simple DNS resolver.

Note: If you are behind a firewall that blocks Google DNS, you will need to set
DNS_TEST_HOST in your environment to pass the tests.

## Example Usage ##

    my $resolver = Net::DNS.new('8.8.8.8'); # google dns server

    my @mx-ips = $resolver.lookup-mx('gmail.com');

    my @all = $resolver.lookup-ips('google.com');
    my @ipv4 = $resolver.lookup-ips('google.com', :inet);
    my @ipv6 = $resolver.lookup-ips('google.com', :inet6);

    my @dns-answers = $resolver.lookup('A', 'google.com'); # ("1.2.3.4", "5.6.7.8", ...)

## Methods ##

 -  `new(Str $host, $socket = IO::Socket::INET)`
    
    Creates a new DNS resolver using the specified DNS server.

    The `$socket` parameter lets you inject your own socket class to use for the
    query (so you can do a proxy negotiation or somesuch first).

 -  `lookup-ips(Str $name, :$inet, :$inet6)`

    Looks up the specified $name, looking for A and AAAA records (only searches
    for A when :inet is specified, and only searches for AAAA when :inet6 is
    specified). Will chase down CNAME records to get you the actual IP
    addresses. Will return a list of A and AAAA responses.

 -  `lookup-mx(Str $name, :$inet, :$inet6)`

    Does a lookup for MX records, and then internally calls `lookup-ips` to
    find the actual addresses for the mailservers. Returns a list of A and AAAA
    records, in MX priority order.

 -  `lookup(Str $type, Str $name)`

    Looks up the specified $name, looking for records of $type. Returns a list of
    response classes, specified below. A failed lookup returns an empty list.

## Supported DNS Types ##

The return of a lookup is a list of classes. Which class depends on the request
type.

The object returned will stringify to something useful, and will also provide
attributes to access each piece of information that was returned.

Note that all of these classes also have a `@.owner-name` attribute. Normally this
is the same as the domain name you did the lookup on.

 -  `A`

    Returns a class with attribute `@.octets`, which will have 4 elements.

    Stringifies to an ip address ("192.168.0.1")

 -  `AAAA`

    Returns a class with attribute `@.octets`, which will have 16 elements.

    Stringifies to an ipv6 address ("2607:f8b0:â€¦")

 -  `CNAME`

    Returns a class with attribute `@.name`, which is a domain name split on '.'.
    To get the full domain name, call $object.name.join('.');

    Stringifies to a domain name.

 -  `MX`

    Returns a class with attributes `$.priority`, `@.name`.

    Stringifies to a domain name.

 -  `NS`

    Returns a class with attribute `@.name`

    Stringifies to a domain name.

 -  `PTR`

    Returns a class with attribute `@.name`

    Stringifies to a domain name.

 -  `RRSIG`

    Returns a class with attributes `$.type-covered`, `$.algorithm`,
    `$.labels`, `$.original-ttl`, `$.signature-expiration`,
    `$.signature-inception`, `$.key-tag`, `$.signer-name`, and
    `$.signature`.

    Stringifies to a a string with similar output to the output produced
    by the `dig` command line utility.

    Note that this module does not validate the validity of a DNSSEC signature.

 -  `SRV`

    Returns a class with the attributes `$.priority`, `$.weight`, `$.port`, `@.name`.

    Stringifies to "the.server:port".

 -  `SPF`

    Returns a class with the attribute `$.text`

    Stringifies to the text

 -  `TXT`

    Returns a class with the attribute `$.text`

    Stringifies to the text

 -  `SOA`

    Returns a class with the attributes `@.mname`, `@.rname`, `$.serial`, `$.refresh`,
    `$.retry`, `$.expire`, `$.minimum`

    Stringifies to a format similar to nslookup

 -  `AXFR`

    Zone transfer request.

    This is a special case - it returns a list of the above objects instead of it's
    own response type.

## Exceptions ##

DNS Server errors will produce a Failure response on lookup(), lookup-ips(), and lookup-mx() with an X::Net::DNS object.

 - server-message

   A complete Net::DNS::Message structured response from the server.

 - rcode-value

   Return code Integer received from the DNS server.

 - rcode-name

   [Return code name](https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/232254248-Common-DNS-return-codes-for-any-DNS-service-and-Umbrella-)
   received from the DNS server. Common values are SERVFAIL and NXDOMAIN.

 - message

   A short english message which might be shown to users.
